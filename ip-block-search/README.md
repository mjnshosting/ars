# Instructions
     This is a simple script modified for this project. It logs into the device listed in device-list then dumps the routing table and interface descriptions which are later parsed for insertion into the ARS database. Clogin is used and the .cloginrc file must reside in the same directory as the script to work properly. Examples of the necessary files are included and should be renamed/created without "-example".
     This can be done in different language like PHP, Python, etc. This is made for cisco devices being accessed from a centralized lock down server that I dont have the ability to install php on.
