# Overview:
    The purpose of this project is to make a system that will monitor an email box or folder that receives
    mail about copyright infringement, malicious attacks, or sources of SPAM from leased IPs. Then allow
    Support Staff member to fill in information if necessary before sending out automated notifications
    pertaining to these notices. Settings can be changed depending on the AUP of the provider to send these
    notices out 2 to 3 times or more before requiring further escalation/attention by an engineer or management.
    Over time as more information is entered the system will automatically send out abuse notifications
    since it will keep previously entered information.
